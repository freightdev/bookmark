# 📖 Bookmark — A Standard for Structuring Memory

## ✨ What is Bookmark?

**Bookmark** is a memory-first, Markdown-native standard for organizing thought, action, and intent. It reimagines the traditional file system as a living, breathing **storybook-style environment** — made of **marks**, **markers**, **ribbons**, and **trails** — where every interaction helps the system construct a memory-aware interface.

It is:

* MIT Licensed, like Storybook, Tailwind, and the best open tools
* Designed to work with `.mark`, `.marker`, `.bookmark`, `.mstp`, and `.trail` formats
* UI-agnostic — works in terminal, GUI, markdown viewers, or AR
* Not a book simulator, but a developer storytelling structure — like Storybook, but for logic and memory

## 📘 Core Concepts

| Concept   | Folder   | Description                                |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Shelf** | `shelf/` | Mounting Point for any memory group or set |
| **Book**  | `book/`  | Collection of marks, pages, and trails     |

| Concept  | File    | Description                                             |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MSTP** | `.mstp` | MARK Story Telling Protocol — system-generated logic    |
| **Trail**| `.trail`| System-tracked path between connected marks and markers |

| Concept      | File/Folder               | Description                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Bookmark** | `.bookmark`, `bookmarks/` | Jump point to a mark, marker, or page state   |
| **Page**     | `.page`, `pages/`         | A single context snapshot                     |
| **Mark**     | `.mark`, `marks/`         | Identity or memory tied to a function or flow  |
| **Marker**   | `.marker`, `markers/`     | Tool, helper, or reusable logic chunk         |
| **Ribbon**   | `.ribbon`, `ribbons/`     | Starting point of a memory trail              |

## 🧠 Why Bookmark?

This is not a `.mark` or `.marker` generator — that’s what **MARKeteer Studio** does.

Instead, Bookmark is:

* A Storybook-style interface for linking your `.mark` and `.marker` logic
* A runtime interface for building and following **bookmark flows**
* A shared environment where bookmarks trigger agent actions or self-navigation
* A context-driven tool where adding a `.bookmark` to any `.mark`, `.marker`, `.page`, or `.trail` wires it into the system automatically

All you have to do is:

* Write `packet-pilot.mark.ts` alongside `packet-pilot.ts`
* Write `packet-scanner.marker.py` alongside `packet-scanner.py`
* Add `packet-pilot.bookmark` — and Bookmark will render it into your live trail

The system connects your marks and markers together, creates a visual Bookmark interface, and dynamically builds trails and MSTP records as you go.

## 🔁 MARK Kernel

**MARK** stands for **Memory Aware Reference Kernel**. It routes memory like a story engine, indexing Pages, binding Markers, and stitching your Trails.

---

## 🛠 Usage

```
# Open a bookmark interface like Storybook
bookmark open packet-pilot.bookmark

# View linked marks and markers
bookmark view packet-pilot.mark

# Render a trail
marktrail render packet-pilot.trail
```

---

## 📖 Example Use Cases

* Link `.mark` and `.marker` files to build agent behaviors
* Add `.bookmark` files to connect workflows and trails
* Watch your MSTP trail grow automatically as you work
* Run in dev, test, or production to see memory-based linking and flow in action

## 📜 License

MIT License — because memory belongs to everyone.

Use it. Fork it. Tell your story.
