# 📖 Bookmark — A Standard for Structuring Memory

> *"The system will write the tale — to help you tell your story."*

## ✨ What is Bookmark?

**Bookmark** is a memory-first, Markdown-native standard for organizing thought, action, and intent.
It reimagines the traditional file system as a living, breathing **book** — made of **pages**, **marks**, **ribbons**, and **trails** — where every action becomes part of your evolving story.

It is:

* MIT Licensed, like Storybook, Tailwind, and the best open tools
* Designed for people, tools, and AI agents
* UI-agnostic — works in terminal, GUI, markdown viewers, or AR
* Built on plain files: `.bookmark`,`.mark`, `.marker`, `.book`, `.page`, `.mstp`, `.trail`, `.ribbon`

## 🧠 Why Bookmark?

Traditional file systems simulate **filing cabinets**.
**Bookmark** simulates **living memory**.

* Pages remember where you were.
* Bookmarks guide you back.
* Ribbons tell you what mattered.
* MARKTrail shows you how you got here.
* MSTP tells a story of the bookmarks

---

## 🔁 MARK Kernel

**MARK** stands for **Memory Aware Reference Kernel**.
It routes memory like a story engine, indexing Pages, binding Markers, and stitching your Trails.

---

## 🛠 Usage

```

```

---

## 📖 Example Use Cases

* Build UI agents using `.mark` files
* Create personal knowledge bases with `.book`
* Teach AI systems with `.trail`-based replay logs
* Document mental health, artistic journeys, software debugging, and dispatch operations

## 📜 License

MIT License — because memory belongs to everyone.

Use it. Fork it. Tell your story.
