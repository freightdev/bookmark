# 📖 Marker Ink — A Standard for Structuring Memory

> MIT Licensed, human-first memory structure for agents, tools, and people.

## ✨ What is Bookcase?


> *"The system helps you connect your **books**, **pages**, **marks**, **ribbons**, and **trails***

**Marker Ink** is a memory-first, Markdown-native standard for organizing thought, action, and intent. It reimagines the traditional file system as a living, breathing **storybook-style environment** — made of **books**, **pages**, **marks**, **markers**, **ribbons**, and **trails** — where every interaction helps the system construct a memory-aware interface.

It is:

* MIT Licensed, like Storybook, Tailwind, and the best open tools
* Designed to work with `.mark`, `.marker`, `.bookmark`, `.mstp`, and `.trail` formats
* UI-agnostic — works in terminal, GUI, markdown viewers, or AR
* Not a book simulator, but a developer storytelling structure — like Storybook, but for logic and memory

## 🧠 Why Bookmark?

This is not a `.mark` or `.marker` generator — that’s what **MARK CLI** does.

Instead, Bookmark is:

* A Storybook-style interface for linking your `.mark` and `.marker` logic
* A runtime interface for building and following **bookmark flows**
* A shared environment where bookmarks trigger agent actions or self-navigation
* A context-driven tool where adding a `.bookmark` to any `.page` wires it into the system automatically

All you have to do is:

* Write `packet-pilot.mark.ts` alongside `packet-pilot.ts`
* Write `packet-scanner.marker.py` alongside `packet-scanner.py`
* Add `packet-pilot.bookmark` — and Bookmark will render it into your live trail

The system connects your marks and markers together, creates a visual Bookmark interface, and dynamically builds trails and MSTP records as you go.

## 🔁 MARK Kernel

**MARK** stands for **Memory Aware Reference Kernel**. It routes memory like a story engine, indexing Pages, binding Markers, and stitching your Trails.

---

## 🛠 Usage

```
# Open a bookmark interface like Storybook
bookmark open packet-pilot.bookmark

# View linked marks and markers
bookmark view packet-pilot.mark

# Render a trail
marktrail render mark.trail
```

---

## 📖 Example Use Cases

* Link `.mark` and `.marker` files to build agent behaviors
* Add `.bookmark` files to connect workflows and trails
* Watch your MSTP trail grow automatically as you work
* Run in dev, test, or production to see memory-based linking and flow in action

Use it. Fork it. Tell your story.
